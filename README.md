# ST2187-Coursework
A data-driven analysis of Superstore’s profitability performance in the Southeast Asia (SEA) region, focusing on identifying the root causes of low profit margins despite strong sales. The project incorporates Tableau dashboards to examine regional performance, product-level profitability, shipping cost structures, and discounting behaviour. 
Findings highlight tables as the primary loss-making sub-category, driven largely by excessive discount rates rather than shipping costs. The report develops actionable insights and quantitative projections to evaluate the impact of optimised discount strategies and reduced shipping costs on future profits, concluding with strategic recommendations to enhance regional profitability and operational efficiency.
